## :warning: This repository is archived :warning:
iinkJS grants you high integration flexibility by letting you choose your favorite framework or components. For this reason, we have decided to focus on iinkJS and to discontinue our ready-to-use Web components.

For more information, please see [documentation](https://developer.myscript.com/).

We also provide an example to integrate [iinkJS](https://github.com/MyScript/iinkJS) as webcomponent: [link](https://github.com/MyScript/web-integration-samples).

## Installation

Use an existing project or start a fresh one.

```shell

```

Install `myscript-math-web` and use it as showed in the [Usage](https://github.com/MyScript/myscript-math-web#usage) section.

```shell
npm install myscript-math-web
```


## Usage

1. Create an `index.html` file in the same directory. 

2. Add the following lines in the `head` section to import the library and the webcomponents polyfill.

```html
<script type="module" src="node_modules/myscript-math-web/myscript-math-web.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js"></script>
```  

3. Still in the `head` section, add the following style:

```html
<style>
    myscript-math-web {
        height: 100vh;
    }
</style>
```

4. Use the component in the `body` section with the keys you received by mail.

```html
<myscript-math-web
  applicationkey="YOUR MYSCRIPT DEVELOPER APPLICATION KEY"
  hmackey="YOUR MYSCRIPT DEVELOPER HMAC KEY">
</myscript-math-web>
```

5. Your `index.html` file should look like this:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <script type="module" src="node_modules/myscript-math-web/myscript-math-web.js"></script>
        <script src="node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js"></script>
        <style>
            myscript-math-web {
                height: 100vh;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
      <myscript-math-web
        applicationkey="YOUR MYSCRIPT DEVELOPER APPLICATION KEY"
        hmackey="YOUR MYSCRIPT DEVELOPER HMAC KEY">
      </myscript-math-web>
    </body>
</html>
```

6. Launch a local Web server to start using it! We recommend to use the polymer one, you can find more information on the [Polymer website](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/start/install-3-0).

```
